# The same way you can specify a response model, you can also declare the HTTP status 
# code used for the response with the parameter status_code in any of the path operations

# Note

# Some response codes (see the next section) indicate that the response does not have a body.

# FastAPI knows this, and will produce OpenAPI docs that state there is no response body.

# Shortcut to remember the namesÂ¶
